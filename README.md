# Molecules Clustering
Clustering molecules dynamics on GPU

# Setup
This project uses `g++` and `nvcc` for compilation.  
In the resulting folder from cloning this repository, do the following:
### 1. Download the dataset
For a relatively small dataset of ~30 000 snapshots, download the
[small dataset](https://www.dsimb.inserm.fr/ATLAS/database/ATLAS/1k5n_A/1k5n_A_protein.zip)
and unzip it in a `/dataset_small` folder.  

For the complete dataset of ~200 000 snapshots, download the [dataset](INSERT LINK HERE) and unzip it in a `/dataset` folder.

[For more info on the data](https://www.dsimb.inserm.fr/ATLAS/database/ATLAS/1k5n_A/1k5n_A.html)

### 2. Install cmake
Make sure to have cmake installed, it's used to build the [chemfiles](https://github.com/chemfiles/chemfiles) library locally to read the raw data.  
For linux:
```bash
sudo apt install cmake
```

### 3. Run make
To run the clustering on the small dataset (best for local testing), the default make command does just that:  
```bash
make
```
This will compile the chemfiles library, convert the raw data into a binary file for ease of use and subsequently compiles and runs the main program.  
To target the complete dataset, run the following command:  
```bash
make DATASET=1
```
